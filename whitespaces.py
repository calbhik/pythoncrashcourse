# Whitespace refers to nonprinting chars, such as space,tabs, and end-of-line symbols. Use for organization and readabiltiy

# Adding a tab to your text, using the character combo \t:
# print("\tPython")

# Adding a newline to a string, using the character combo \n:
# print("Languages:\nPython\nC\nJavascript")

# Combine tabs and newlines in a single string. "\n\t" tells Python to move to a new line, and start the next line with a tab.
# print("Languages:\n\tPython\n\tC\n\tJavascript")

#Python can look for extra whitespace on the right and left sides of a string. Ensure that no whitespace exists by using the rstrip method
